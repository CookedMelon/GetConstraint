name: tf.nn.weighted_cross_entropy_with_logits_v2
dependency: 
  - labels
  - logits
  - pos_weight

constraints:
  labels:
    descp: A Tensor of the same type and shape as logits, with values between 0 and 1 inclusive.
    dtype:
      - tf.tensor
    structure:
      - shape: Same as logits

  logits:
    descp: A Tensor of type float32 or float64, any real numbers.
    dtype:
      - tf.float32
      - tf.float64
    structure:
      - shape: Same as labels

  pos_weight:
    descp: A coefficient to use on the positive examples, typically a scalar but otherwise broadcastable to the shape of logits. Its value should be non-negative.
    dtype:
      - tf.tensor
    structure:
      - shape: Broadcastable to shape of logits

  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
    dtype:
      - string

returns:
  descp: A Tensor of the same shape as logits with the componentwise weighted logistic losses.
  dtype:
    - tf.tensor
  structure:
    - shape: Same as logits

errors:
  - ValueError: If logits and labels do not have the same shape.

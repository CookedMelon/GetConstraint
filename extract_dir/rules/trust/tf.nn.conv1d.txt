tf.nn.conv1d(
    input,
    filters,
    stride,
    padding,
    data_format='NWC',
    dilations=None,
    name=None
)
  Args:
    input: A Tensor of rank at least 3. Must be of type `float16`, `float32`, or
      `float64`.
    filters: A Tensor of rank at least 3.  Must have the same type as `input`.
    stride: An int or list of `ints` that has length `1` or `3`.  The number of
      entries by which the filter is moved right at each step.
    padding: 'SAME' or 'VALID'. See
      [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/nn#notes_on_padding_2)
      for more information.
    data_format: An optional `string` from `"NWC", "NCW"`.  Defaults to `"NWC"`,
      the data is stored in the order of
      `batch_shape + [in_width, in_channels]`.  The `"NCW"` format stores data
      as `batch_shape + [in_channels, in_width]`.
    dilations: An int or list of `ints` that has length `1` or `3` which
      defaults to 1. The dilation factor for each dimension of input. If set to
      k > 1, there will be k-1 skipped cells between each filter element on that
      dimension. Dilations in the batch and depth dimensions must be 1.
    name: A name for the operation (optional).
  Returns:
    A `Tensor`.  Has the same type as input.
  Raises:
    ValueError: if `data_format` is invalid.

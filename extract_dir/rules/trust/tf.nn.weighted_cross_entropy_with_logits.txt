@tf_export("nn.weighted_cross_entropy_with_logits", v1=[])
@dispatch.add_dispatch_support
  Args:
    labels: A `Tensor` of the same type and shape as `logits`, with values
      between 0 and 1 inclusive.
    logits: A `Tensor` of type `float32` or `float64`, any real numbers.
    pos_weight: A coefficient to use on the positive examples, typically a
      scalar but otherwise broadcastable to the shape of `logits`. Its value
      should be non-negative.
    name: A name for the operation (optional).
  Returns:
    A `Tensor` of the same shape as `logits` with the componentwise
    weighted logistic losses.
  Raises:
    ValueError: If `logits` and `labels` do not have the same shape.

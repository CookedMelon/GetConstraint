  """Continuously yield new checkpoint files as they appear.
  The iterator only checks for new checkpoints when control flow has been
  reverted to it. This means it can miss checkpoints if your code takes longer
  to run between iterations than `min_interval_secs` or the interval at which
  new checkpoints are written.
  The `timeout` argument is the maximum number of seconds to block waiting for
  a new checkpoint.  It is used in combination with the `timeout_fn` as
  follows:
  * If the timeout expires and no `timeout_fn` was specified, the iterator
    stops yielding.
  * If a `timeout_fn` was specified, that function is called and if it returns
    a true boolean value the iterator stops yielding.
  * If the function returns a false boolean value then the iterator resumes the
    wait for new checkpoints.  At this point the timeout logic applies again.
  This behavior gives control to callers on what to do if checkpoints do not
  come fast enough or stop being generated.  For example, if callers have a way
  to detect that the training has stopped and know that no new checkpoints
  will be generated, they can provide a `timeout_fn` that returns `True` when
  the training has stopped.  If they know that the training is still going on
  they return `False` instead.
  Args:
    checkpoint_dir: The directory in which checkpoints are saved.
    min_interval_secs: The minimum number of seconds between yielding
      checkpoints.
    timeout: The maximum number of seconds to wait between checkpoints. If left
      as `None`, then the process will wait indefinitely.
    timeout_fn: Optional function to call after a timeout.  If the function
      returns True, then it means that no new checkpoints will be generated and
      the iterator will exit.  The function is called with no arguments.
  Yields:
    String paths to latest checkpoint files as they arrive.

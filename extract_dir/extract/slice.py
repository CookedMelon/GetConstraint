  """Extracts a slice from a tensor.
  See also `tf.strided_slice`.
  This operation extracts a slice of size `size` from a tensor `input_` starting
  at the location specified by `begin`. The slice `size` is represented as a
  tensor shape, where `size[i]` is the number of elements of the 'i'th dimension
  of `input_` that you want to slice. The starting location (`begin`) for the
  slice is represented as an offset in each dimension of `input_`. In other
  words, `begin[i]` is the offset into the i'th dimension of `input_` that you
  want to slice from.
  Note that `tf.Tensor.__getitem__` is typically a more pythonic way to
  perform slices, as it allows you to write `foo[3:7, :-2]` instead of
  `tf.slice(foo, [3, 0], [4, foo.get_shape()[1]-2])`.
  `begin` is zero-based; `size` is one-based. If `size[i]` is -1,
  all remaining elements in dimension i are included in the
  slice. In other words, this is equivalent to setting:
  `size[i] = input_.dim_size(i) - begin[i]`
  This operation requires that:
  `0 <= begin[i] <= begin[i] + size[i] <= Di  for i in [0, n]`
  For example:
  ```python
  t = tf.constant([[[1, 1, 1], [2, 2, 2]],
                   [[3, 3, 3], [4, 4, 4]],
                   [[5, 5, 5], [6, 6, 6]]])
  tf.slice(t, [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 3])  # [[[3, 3, 3]]]
  tf.slice(t, [1, 0, 0], [1, 2, 3])  # [[[3, 3, 3],
                                     #   [4, 4, 4]]]
  tf.slice(t, [1, 0, 0], [2, 1, 3])  # [[[3, 3, 3]],
                                     #  [[5, 5, 5]]]
  ```

    name: A name for the operation (optional).
  Returns:
    A `Tensor` the same type as `input_`.

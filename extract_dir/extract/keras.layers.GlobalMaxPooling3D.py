    Args:
      data_format: A string,
        one of `channels_last` (default) or `channels_first`.
        The ordering of the dimensions in the inputs.
        `channels_last` corresponds to inputs with shape
        `(batch, spatial_dim1, spatial_dim2, spatial_dim3, channels)`
        while `channels_first` corresponds to inputs with shape
        `(batch, channels, spatial_dim1, spatial_dim2, spatial_dim3)`.
        It defaults to the `image_data_format` value found in your
        Keras config file at `~/.keras/keras.json`.
        If you never set it, then it will be "channels_last".
      keepdims: A boolean, whether to keep the spatial dimensions or not.
        If `keepdims` is `False` (default), the rank of the tensor is reduced
        for spatial dimensions.
        If `keepdims` is `True`, the spatial dimensions are retained with
        length 1.
        The behavior is the same as for `tf.reduce_max` or `np.max`.
    Input shape:
      - If `data_format='channels_last'`:
        5D tensor with shape:
        `(batch_size, spatial_dim1, spatial_dim2, spatial_dim3, channels)`
      - If `data_format='channels_first'`:
        5D tensor with shape:
        `(batch_size, channels, spatial_dim1, spatial_dim2, spatial_dim3)`
    Output shape:
      - If `keepdims`=False:
        2D tensor with shape `(batch_size, channels)`.
      - If `keepdims`=True:
        - If `data_format='channels_last'`:
          5D tensor with shape `(batch_size, 1, 1, 1, channels)`
        - If `data_format='channels_first'`:
          5D tensor with shape `(batch_size, channels, 1, 1, 1)`
